# FoodDeliveryApp

A customized app that allows users to order from ten restaurants where each restaurant provides four dishes. Users can review their order and make payments through the cart page. A history page is provided so that the user can track the status of their order while a profile page is provided so that users can view and alter their personal information.

This is implemented through the use of android libraries and firebase where the list of restaurants and orders are stored in firebase while the users' personal info is stored in room database.
